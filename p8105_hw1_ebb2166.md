Homework 1
================
E. Brennan Bollman

This is my solution to homework 1.

# Section 1

Hereâ€™s a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too\! The mean is 0.0270543.
